# Ash Fit Personal Trainer

#### Code Institute Milestone 1 project

The website can be found [here](https://annemariesheehan.github.io/First-Milestone-Project/).

The idea for the website came from a friends new business. The website was created to highlight her skills and the services available to potential customers. 

## UX

### Strategy

The design goal was to make the relevant information accessable to the target market. I wanted the site to draw people in and explore further for the information they didn't know they needed yet. 

### Scope
This website is for any athlete or hobbiest sports person, whether runner, cyclist, triathlete or adventure racer so that they can find out about Ash Fit and how the services can benefit them. The site includes quick and easy ways to contact her for further information. 

### User Stories
1. As a runner, I want access to information online about how I can improve my running and get stronger, faster and fitter. I would also like to know how to rehab an injury and what food I should eat to get the best from my training. 
2. As a cyclist, I want access to regular, affordable sports massage therapy to keep my limbs supple for long bike rides and some seasonal racing. 
3. As a woman looking to improve general health and fitness I'm not sure where to start, I'd like to find a professional who can guide me with general fitness, strength and nutrition. 

### Skeleton 



### Surface
I chose a dark to light colour scheme to make the site striking and dramatic to draw in the user. I also choose clean lines and clearly separted sections to make for easy reading.  

## Features

### Existing Features
I added a fixed image background that has a parralax effect. 
I used the flip cards feature in Bootstrap to make the services cards flip on hover for further inforation. 


### Features left to Implement
In the future I would like to implement the full parallax scrollopsy feature. I would also add in Modals to allow pop up informaiton to display in key areas. 

## Technologies used

## Testing

*W3Schools validator
Google Chrome developer tools
Peer Code Review on Slack*

1. W3Schools Validator. I pasted the HTML from my project into the validator and got 8 warnings. These included spaces in image names, errors in the contact form where names did not match ID's as well as some h1 warnings. I amended the errors and reposted the code. I then pasted the CSS code and ran the validation again, this time finding 8 errors although they all related to a one duplicate line which, when removed showed no errors. 
1. To check for errors using google chrome developer tools, I right clicked on my finished website and chose inspect. The only error showing related to a cookie, the message was "A cookie associated with a cross-site resource at http://fontawesome.com/ was set without the `SameSite` attribute. A future release of Chrome will only deliver cookies with cross-site requests if they are set with `SameSite=None` and `Secure`. You can review cookies in developer tools under Application>Storage>Cookies and see more details at https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592 and https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5633521622188032." As I don't fully understand this, further investigation is required. 

## Deployment 
 The site was deployed to github pages from Visual Studio Code as follows:
 1. Log into my GitHub account
 2. Choose the relevant repositry
 3. Ensure all changes have been pushed from VS to GitHub
 4. Click on the settings tab
